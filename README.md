# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install Node.js Dependencies

First, you will need to install the project's Node.js dependencies:

```bash
# using npm
npm install
```

## Step 2: Install iOS Dependencies (Pods)

Next, you'll need to install the iOS-specific dependencies via CocoaPods. Use the following npm script to install the pods:

```bash
# using npm
npm run pod-install
```

## Step 3: Running the iOS App

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can run the iOS version of the app. Use the following command to launch the app on the iOS simulator:

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios
```
